 Here's a step-by-step guide for coders to run the React website code on their local machine:

1.Download and install Node.js on your computer. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org.

2.Clone the repository that contains your React website code from GitHub to your local machine using a Git client or by downloading the ZIP file from the repository.

3.Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder that contains the React website code.

4.Install the necessary dependencies for the website. You can install the dependencies using the command "npm install".
react-router-dom;

5.Run the website by executing the main JavaScript file for the website. This file is usually named index.js and is located in the root directory of the project. You can run the website using the command "npm start" in the terminal.

6.Once the website is running, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 or the port number specified in the console output.

7.Test the website by interacting with it in the web browser.

That's it! If everything is working correctly, you should now be able to run and test the React website code that you downloaded from GitHub on your local machine.
